# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

When a version is sended to verification to the store, the version actually used become deprecated.
If you found a vunlerability don't wait to see if the new version is patched, because since the code is reviewed mannually it take some time and i have the possibility to change the code to be reviewed before the review begin.

## Whats the commit "Verification commit" ?
This commit is a commit to signal that i have checked all the code at this commit to securise my account.
From now i will not add any commit not verified or with an external key to ensure the safety of my project.

The project is also uploaded to the differents store on a Fully secured hardware & software, See my repository (will add lik later), to know more about that.

The version 7.1 of the application is a minor update with the version of the "Verified commit", the version 7.0 have removed any "reading" capabilities of the extension to also add more security.

## Account Security
My microsoft Account security is protected with 2FA, Windows hello enforced on an updated software.\
My Account have now "Paswordless" function activated and imune to bruteforce attack since the password is totally removed.\
Also the email used for connection is unique (i use unique email for every services).

## Manifest V3
V7 added migration to Manifest V3, who add many security/privacy improvement to the project, these improvement have forced me to remove some feature (css for screllbar) because the V3 will have forced me to ask the permission to read/modify all your website page, and since i do not want to ask this permission and create an extension who rely on trust, i have removed it.
